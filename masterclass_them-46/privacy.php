                            Saint-Tran does not own or control, or to individuals that Saint-Tran does not employ or manage 
                            (“Third Parties”). While we attempt to provide access only to those Third Parties that share our respect
                            for your privacy, we cannot take responsibility for the content, actions or privacy policies of those 
                            Third Parties. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of any Third Parties you access.

                            The Services use cookies and similar technologies such as pixel tags, web beacons, clear GIFs, and JavaScript
                            (collectively, “Cookies”) to enable our servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how and when you visit 
                            and use our Site and Services, to analyze trends, learn about our user base and operate and improve our Services. 
                            Cookies are small files – usually consisting of letters and numbers – placed on your computer, tablet, phone, or 
                            similar device when you use that device to visit our Site. We sometimes combine information collected through
                            Cookies that is not Personal Data with Personal Data that we have about you, for example, to tell us who you are
                            or whether you have an account with us. We may also supplement the information we collect from you with 
                            information received from third parties.    
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Cookies can either be “session Cookies” or “persistent Cookies”. Session Cookies are temporary Cookies that are stored 
                        on your device while you are visiting our Site or using our Services, whereas “persistent Cookies” are stored on your 
                        device for a period of time after you leave our Site or Services. The length of time a persistent Cookie stays on your 
                        device varies from Cookie to Cookie. We use persistent Cookies to store your preferences so that they are available for 
                        the next visit, and to keep a more accurate account of how often you visit our Services, how often you return, how your
                        use of the Services may vary over time. We also use persistent Cookies to measure the effectiveness of advertising efforts. 
                        Through these Cookies, we may collect information about your online activity after you leave our Services. Your browser may
                        offer you a “Do Not Track” or “DNT” option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites, and web applications, and 
                        services that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites.
                        Because we collect browsing and persistent identifier data, the Services do not support Do Not Track requests at this time,
                        which means that we may collect information about your online activity both while you are using the Services and after you 
                        leave our properties.
                        </p>

                        Some Cookies are placed by a third party on your device and may provide information to us and third parties about your 
                        browsing habits (such as your visits to our Site or Services, the pages you have visited and the links and advertisements
                        you have clicked). These Cookies can be used to determine whether certain third party services are being used,
                        to identify your interests, to retarget advertisements to you and to serve advertisements to you that we or others 
                        believe are relevant to you. We do not control third party Cookies.
                        </p>
                        <p>We use the following types of Cookies:</p>

                                that you have requested. For example, certain Cookies enable you to log into secure areas of our 
                                Site or Services. Disabling these Cookies may make certain features and services unavailable.

                        settings. Most browsers have an option for turning off the Cookie feature, which will prevent your browser

                        already on your computer. If you do this, however, you may have to manually adjust some preferences every

                            We may serve advertisements, and also allow third party ad networks, including third party ad servers, 
                            ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms, to serve advertisements through the Services. 
                            These advertisements may be targeted to users who fit certain general profile categories or display 
                            certain preferences or behaviors (“Interest-Based Ads”). Information for Internet-Based Ads (including 
                            Personal Data) may be provided to us by you, or derived from the usage patterns of particular users on 
                            the Services and/or services of Third Parties. Such information may be gathered through tracking users’ 
                            activities across time and unaffiliated properties. To accomplish this, we or our service providers may 
                            deliver Cookies, including a file (known as a “web beacon”) from an ad network to you through the Services. 
                            Web beacons allow ad networks to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for us and 
                            for advertisers. Web beacons also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit 
                            other websites. Web beacons allow ad networks to view, edit or set their own Cookies on your browser, just 
                            as if you had requested a web page from their site.

                            and marketing associations have developed an industry self-regulatory program to give consumers a better 
                            understanding of and greater control over ads that are customized based on their online behavior across 
                            different websites. To make choices about Interest-Based Ads from participating third parties, including
